Character Art<br>
From Star Art, derive the following that will accept and draw the given characters, not just asterisks:<br>

drawLeftChars(num, char)<br>
drawRightChars(num, char)<br>
drawCenterChar(num, char)<br>
For all three of these, you can safely assume that 'char' is a string with length 1.
