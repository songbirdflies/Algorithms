<h2>Random Chance</h2><p>Let's play the slots!</p><p>Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).</p><p>There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 coins - use <code>Math.random</code> and <code>Math.floor</code> to pick a random number of coins).</p><p>While the user still has quarters, use <code>Math.random</code> to determine if they won.</p><p>If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).</p><p>Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.</p><p>Bonus (Only If You Have Time):</p><ul>
<li>Let the user pass the number they are willing to leave with<ul>
<li>(ex: If they won the lottery and still have 40 coins, they will keep playing until they have collected 200 coins)</li></ul></li></ul>
