Letter Grade<br>
Mr. Cerise teaches high school math. Write a function that assigns and prints a letter grade, given an integer representing a score from 0 to 100? Those getting 90+ get an ‘A’, 80-89 earn ‘B’, 70-79 is a ‘C’, 60-69 should get a ‘D’, and lower than 60 receive ‘F’.

Example: given 88, you should log "Score:88. Grade: B". Given the score 61, log the string "Score: 61. Grade: D".</body>
