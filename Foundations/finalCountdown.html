The Final Countdown<br>
This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don’t print) that one. Do this using a WHILE loop.

Example: Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, except for the value 9).
