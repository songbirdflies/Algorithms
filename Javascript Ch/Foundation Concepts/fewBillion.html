<h2>For a Few Billion</h2><p>There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).</p><p>Use <code>for</code> loops to answer the following:</p><ul>
 <li>How much was the reward after 30 days?</li></ul><p>
 <em>remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01</em></p><p>Bonus (Only If You Have Time):</p><ul>
 <li>How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?</li> <li>How about 1 billion?</li> <li>In JavaScript, there is a value <code>Infinity</code>, how many days until the servant has infinite money?</li></ul>
